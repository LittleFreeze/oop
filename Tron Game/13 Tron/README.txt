Program By Evan Von Duhn

I moddified the Tron game by adding in classes for the game, board, and players.
I also added functions create the classes and have them interact with each other.

Update 4/9/2019
I added a jump function mapped to spacebar and numpad0 which causes the player's bike to disappear for 10 ticks before reappearing.
I also moddified the code to generate two randomly collored bikes instead of the red and green.
