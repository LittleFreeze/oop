Program By Evan Von Duhn

The goal of this program is to simulate the card game War using abstractions.

First I had to be able to create the deck of cards that will be used in the game.
I used a full class to represent a deck of cards, and a struct to represent each individual card.
I kept the deck in order by using single linked list of the cards.
Each player then had their own deck that would be used to keep track of their cards.
